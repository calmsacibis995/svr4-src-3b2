ABSTRACT: Schedule Backups to Run Automatically
	The "schedule" menu allows you to schedule backups to run
	automatically.  You can add scheduled backups, change the existing
	schedule, display the current schedule or remove backups from the
	schedule.  Since the backups are scheduled to run automatically and
	are not associated with a terminal, you must choose to run them
	either in automatic or background mode.
