TITLE:the Summary Configuration Information screen

ABSTRACT:
	The "summary" task provides a report on the system configuration.  It
	lists the amount of memory configured on the system, followed by a
	report on boards and devices attached to the system.

LISTING:
	This list describes the peripherals that are installed on the system.
	The first line describes the machine type.  The second line describes
	the amount of memory configured on the machine.  The table of system
	peripherals describes the (abbreviated) name of the board on which
	the device is attached, the subdevices (by name) attached to that
	board, and the extended subdevices attached via an extended bus or an
	interface like the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI).
