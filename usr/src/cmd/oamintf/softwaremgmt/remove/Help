ABSTRACT:
	This task removes software packages from the system or spooled
	on a device.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the word "installed" to indicate that you want to remove 
	software which is currently installed on your system.  To remove 
	software which is spooled, enter the device on which the software 
	resides (e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1".)  To indicate the default 
	spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	Enter the word "all" to remove all packages.  If you wish to remove
	a specific package, enter the package instance identifier (e.g., 
	"spell" or "rfs").  You may enter multiple package identifiers by 
	separating each one with a comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing".)  To 
	remove all instances of a particular package, use a wildcard format 
	such as "dbase.*".
