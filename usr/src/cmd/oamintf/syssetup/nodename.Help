display:TITLE:Displaying System Name and Network Node Name of the Machine
set:TITLE:Setting System Name and Network Node Name of the Machine

ABSTRACT:
	This procedure allows you to display and/or change the system name
	and the network node name of this machine.  The system name is used
	to identify this machine.  The node name is used by various 
	communications networks to identify this machine.  Some system 
	architectures require that the system name and the network node name
	be the same.  

display:ABSTRACT:
	This procedure displays the system name and the network node name
	of this machine.  The system name is used by this system to identify
	this machine.  The node name is used by various communications
	networks to identify this machine.  Some system architectures 
	require that the system name and the network node name be the same.

Form.nodeset:sysname:
	Enter the system name to call this machine.  The system name is used 
	to identify this machine.  The name can be up to 8 alphanumeric 
	characters - ( A through Z, a through z, 0 through 9 ) and can 
	include a dash and an underbar.

Form.nodeset:nodename:
	Enter the network node name. The node name is used by various 
	communications networks to identify this machine.  The name can be 
	up to 8 alphanumeric characters - ( A through Z, a through z, 0 
	through 9 ) and can include a dash and an underbar.

Text.nodeokay:ABSTRACT:
	The system name and node name for your machine have been set as you 
	requested.  If the node name was set for the first time, simply 
	provide it to others in your network that need to communicate with
	your machine.  Otherwise, if the node name was reset, make sure
	any references to the old node name within the network are changed 
	as well.
