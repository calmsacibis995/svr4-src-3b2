	The file system must have been previously mounted
	for it to be unmounted via this task.

Form.unmount:F1:Device containing file system to be unmounted:
	Devices that contain file systems are usually partitions on
	the hard disk. For example the partition /dev/dsk/c1d0s2 is
	the second partition on the zeroeth hard disk.  Partitions 
	are created on hard disks by using the "Partition" task.
 	Among other devices which can contain file systems floppy 
	diskette drives are the most common. 
	
	Devices can be accessed via either of block or character
	interfaces. The block interface to the device causes data
	on the device to be accessed in a buffered manner. The 
	character interface provides character input/output to the 
	device. For example buffered I/O can be performed on a floppy 
	device by specifying the block interface "/dev/diskette"
	and character I/O can be performed by specifying "/dev/rdiskette"
	which is the character interface to this device.
