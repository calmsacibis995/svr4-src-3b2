* Timer resolution is expressed as the number of times per second the
* clock ticks.
* The hrtimes array is used for keeping track of sleep and alarm
* requests for the standard real-time clock.
* The itimes array is used for keeping track of the alarm requests
* for the clocks measuring user process virtual time and a process'
* virtual time.
